We are the IT department at St. Louis Christian College. We provide the
students, faculty, and staff of SLCC with tech support and technology
resources to help them learn, study, and grow.

Here you might find some interesting information about what we're up to,
or you might learn some new tech tricks to show off to all your friends.

If you need tech support, send us an email to [helpdesk [at] stlchristian [dot] edu](mailto:helpdesk@stlchristian.edu),
and we'll get back with you as soon as we can.

Thanks for stopping by!
