title: "[Tech Tip] Fix Your Computer"

I know this gets over-stated an awful lot. But, honestly, rebooting your
computer can fix whatever quirky thing it's doing quite often. I always
recommend that a reboot be the first course of action whenever you come
across some unexpected behavior from your comptuer.  Here's how to reboot
your computer for a few operating systems:

1. [Windows XP](#windows-xp)
1. [Windows Vista](#windows-vista)
1. [Windows 7](#windows-7)
1. [Windows 8 or 8.1](#windows-8)
1. [Mac OS X](#mac-os-x)
1. [Linux](#linux)

### Windows XP ###

First things first: If you're using a computer that is still running
Windows XP, we need to fix that! Windows XP has been EOL (End of Life)
for a little bit, now. It's time for us to move on :) Here's how to give
it a reboot:

With Windows XP, it's a little different than any other version of Windows
that we're covering today. You actually begin by clicking **Start** -->
**Shutdown**

Then, you'll have some options. I've chosen **Restart** from the dropdown
menu, and then I'll click **OK**. After that, you're on your way!

### Windows Vista ###

Technically, this is Windows Server 2008. But, they're pretty much the
same when it comes to the user interface. To reboot, I'm clicking the
**Start** menu, click the right-facing arrow in the bottom-right corner,
and selecting **Restart**.

### Windows 7 ###

Technically, this is Windows Server 2008 R2 (are you sensing a theme?).
The interface, though, is very similar to Windows 7. The steps are
identical to those for Windows Vista. The look over the interface has
only been updated a tad. To reboot, I'm clicking the **Start** menu, click
the right-facing arrow in the bottom-right corner, and selecting **Restart**.

### Windows 8 ###

Here, you're getting an extra tip. If you hit the **Windows Key** (usually
somewhere between **Ctrl** and **Alt**), and **X** you can see the super-secret
admin menu. With this menu, you have a quick way to reboot your machine.
Note that in this example, I have some updates that Windows wants to apply
before it performs the reboot.

### Mac OS X ###

If you're using Mac OS, you're literally two clicks away from a reboot.
To start, I've clicked to open the **Apple** menu (the apple icon in the
top-left corner of the screen), and then I've chosen **Restart...**
Couldn't be any easier!

### Linux ###

I'm going to assume that if you've managed to install your preferred
distribution of Linux that you're familiar with how to successfully reboot
your computer.

That Said, on my laptop running Linux Mint with the Cinnamon Desktop,
here's how:

[![Reboot your computer in Linux](/img/reboot-linux.png)](/img/reboot-linux.png)

I click the **Start** menu and choose the **Quit** button. This is the button
in the lower-left corner (in this picture it looks embossed). A pop-up
will appear asking what you'd like to do (Shut Down, Restart, etc.).
Choose restart, and you're off to the races!
